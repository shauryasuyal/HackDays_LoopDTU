## Features 

###  For Students
* **Real-Time Caddy Tracking**: See actively moving caddies and ambulances on a live campus map.
* **AI-Powered Dispatcher**: Request rides using natural language (e.g., "Need a ride for 3 people from Amul Lane to Raj Soin"). The AI understands campus landmarks and redirects you if a location isn't accessible by vehicle.
* **Vision Locator ("Where am I?")**: Lost on campus? Upload a photo of your surroundings, and the AI will identify your location to help you book a ride or start navigating.
* **Explore Mode (Navigator)**: Get walking directions across campus with turn-by-turn route tracking that notifies you upon arrival.
* **DTU Assistant Chat**: A built-in AI chatbot to answer campus-related questions or provide specific directions based on your current location.

### For Drivers
* **Ride Request Heatmap**: See student ride requests appear instantly on the map with passenger counts.
* **Driver-to-Driver Visibility**: See positions of other caddies to coordinate coverage across campus.
* **Simple Status Toggling**: easy Go Online/Offline switch for shift management.

### Emergency & Safety
* **SOS Triage AI**: An intelligent emergency chatbot that assesses the situation (e.g., checks for injuries or bleeding) before dispatching an ambulance.
* **Instant GPS Beacon**: In critical emergencies, students can force-dispatch an ambulance directly to their exact GPS coordinates, bypassing standard pickup zones.
